# Bluebird Hardware Overview
The Bluebird hardware is built around the nRF52840 chipset.  The nRF52840 combines network and application processing into a single chipset and includes support for a variety of on-chip peripherals.  Bluebird leverages the nRF52840’s integrated USB 2.0 controller for both drag-and-drop programming and debugging without requiring any additional hardware. Bluebird includes a 6-axis accelerometer, light/color sensor, piezo speaker, Neopixel LED, and temperature sensor.  
Two key pieces of information to help understand the internals of the Bluebird is schematic, which shows the detailed component data and connectivity of the device.

# Hardware Description
nRF52 Application Processor
The nRF52 application processor is where user programs run. A single, complete application including user code, runtime code and Bluetooth stack is loaded and run directly from on chip flash memory. All user accessible GPIO pins are provided by this processor. There is an onboard 2.4GHz radio engine used to provide Bluetooth capabilities via an off-chip aerial.

# General Purpose Input/Output Pins

The central breakout connector brings out many of the GPIO circuits of the application processor. None of these circuits are shared with other functions of the Bluebird.
Note: the nRF52840 datasheet states that GPIO pins may be in std-drive (15mA) and high-drive (5mA) mode, with a maximum of 3 pins in high-drive mode at any one time.
