# Using the Pins

Pins let your @boardname@ interact with the outside world. They let you run servos, read switch settings, turn on LEDs, talk to sensors, and much more. You have blocks that let you use the pins in different ways by your programs. How you connect and program the pins depends on how you want to use them. This tutorial shows you the different ways the pins are connected and how you code for them.

For each type of pin usage, there are some simple examples with an experiment help learn how to use the pin. There are a few materials you'll need if you wnt test out the expirements. You can go through all of the pin tutorials or just check out the one's you need to learn about right now.

## Types of Pins

The @boardname@ has several pins located around its edge. Some of these are deditcated to providing a supply voltage our a place for grounding a circuit. The other pins are available to use for digital I/O, analog I/O, servos, or communication with sensors and other boards.

Some of these pins are configurable for use in both digital or analog I/O. This means they can have different input and output modes. When you use the blocks for these in a program, they are configured for the proper mode before any input is read or output sent.
