Creating a stuffed critter of some kind is a great fabric arts project that is suitable for beginners (who have patience!) on up. Once you have sewn the Fabric Friend, you can find a variety of fun and challenging ways to code it to respond to the world. 

## Duration

The time required will vary depending upon the complexity of the creation and the skill level of the creators. Two hours is probably a bare minimum to create a creature.

## Skills gained

Sewing, coding with variables, conditionals and logic

## Academic Tie-in Ideas

* **Science**: create friends that are cells, fungi, planets, or other curriculum-related entities. 
* **History**: make an object from the past.
* **Literature**: make an object that’s important to the plot or symbolism of a story.

## Materials 

* Flora NeoPixels
* Conductive 2 or 3-ply thread
* Normal sewing thread 
* Small needle
* Scissors
* Fabric of choice. Felt works well and is easier to work with.
* Stuffing material, like fiber fill
* Clear nail polish
* Alligator clip wires

### Optional

* Fabric scissors (helpful!)
* Embroidery thread (for additional embellishment) 
* Fabric glue (to hold NeoPixels down for sewing)
* Fabric pen or tailor’s chalk
