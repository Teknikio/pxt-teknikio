The [Control Center](https://tekniverse.teknikio.com/tools/control-center) can be found on all Tekniverse Apps (mobile, mac, and web). This page serves as a dashboard for all of the sensors and outputs on your board, so that you can verify that everything is working. For Tekniverse users you can also save incoming data and share a live stream of your Control Center with your collaborators!

The "controls" on Control Center are the gray buttons with corresponding icons for each component of Bluebird. If you click on the button it will turn green to show that it is active. For inputs, clicking on the button will show or hide a graph with data being plotted over time.

For outputs you will see a pop-up configuration window that allows you to set the propoerty of the component. For example, if you click on the LED, you will see a window with different color options for the LED.

Try clicking on the music button, you should see a playable keyboard! If you play these keys you will hear the notes played on the speaker of your board.

The graphs have additional buttons where you can customize the units or axis that you are viewing. For example, on the accelerometer graph you can choose the x, y, z axis or some combination of all 3!
For the temperature graph you can display the data in Farenheit or Celsius.
